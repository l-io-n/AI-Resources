##### Installation
Download the `.png` file of the Pocket Notes version you want. Pull up your scenario in NovelAI and open the Lorebook. In the top left corner of the Lorebook window, click the icon depicting an up-arrow pointing into a box. Select the `.png` and click Open.

##### Usage
The Pocket Notes Lorebook is safe and will not conflict with most other Lorebook Entries. On it's own, Pocket Notes does nothing and makes no changes to your story until you invoke one of its commands (shown below).
<br>Simply type the command (optionally surrounded by square brackets `[``]`) into your story followed by an input relating to the command, and hit Send. Pocket Notes will automatically add a newline followed by a corresponding output.
<br><sub>For more information and command specific notes, please refer to the [Details and Disclaimers](#details-and-disclaimers) section.</sub>

[^1]: Note that Pocket Editor commands require bracket encapsulation in order to work, and can be limited by your Token Context Limit. This is due to the potentially large passages of inputs they accept. That said, newlines are allowed, unlike with other commands.
[^2]: Regarding Perspective Converter commands, the # after `Per` corresponds with the 1st/2nd/3rd person perspective. The optional `m` or `f` following the number denotes a male or female character conversion respectively.
[^3]: For the Prompt Generator command, note that the optional # after `Start` corresponds with the 1st/2nd/3rd person perspective. Leaving `Start` without a following number allows any perspective of the prompt to be generated.

> This contains the previous version of Pocket Notes published by @lion and few new generators for the words - Ambience, Equipment, Plants, Wildlife, Creatures. A small project I'm working on with lion's cooperation. Very small tweaks were made to the Narrators for personal taste such as grammar tweaks and enforcing the [ Dialogue: ] format for the narrators.

> Ambience adds and generates Ambience for any environment/scenario you request. Equipment generates a relatively detailed description of the character's gear. Plants generates plant life for the requested environment. Wildlife does the same for real-life animals (and monsters if you use a fantasy heavy prompt), Creatures is similar but specialized for fantasy and monsters. The mentioned keywords are complete, but I have a few more words to experiment with and add to make this a more complete generator package. So consider this a complete preview version! Looking forward to sharing work with lion and friends to make pocket notes and add-ons even greater.

#### Details and Disclaimers
 Due to the differences in token weights, this lorebook is intended for use with v4 trained modules and may not work correctly with old modules.

 To utilize this lorebook, you need to type specific commands. You can use upper/lowercase and optionally encapsulate your command in brackets. Some commands work better with or without brackets.

 Newlines are not necessary after your command. Likewise, the spacing within brackets does not matter and all commands should work fine with [Command as well as [ Command.

 Slash / commands have been removed for consistency. All commands now require a colon : after the command keyword.
Check the associated lorebook entries for more examples.

 Results may vary. If you're having trouble, try changing up your phrasing since the AI might not like the tokens you are using.

 If not using brackets, it is recommended to either delete or comment out a command (by putting two hashtags like ## at the start of the line) after use so that the AI doesn't start repeating input commands itself.
 You can also surround your input in brackets which will prevent the AI from repeating the commands if you have Ban Bracket Generation enabled.

 All Pocket Editors have a large Search Range, meaning their lorebook keys may continue to trigger more than once, especially with a shorter Output Length setting (such as the default). Thus, it is recommended to comment out or delete Pocket Editor commands after they are used.

 Prompt generation with Per requires numbers 1-3 such as Per1, Per2, or Per3 to work. Per can also specify a gender for the third person generation via Per3m or Per3f.
 The Start command can also specify a perspective with a number as above. It is also encouraged to include a character name to be included in the prompt for Start, followed by a comma.

 While some commands (such as Start, Setup, and Plot) can be used on their own without any additional input, most work best when given an input following the command on the same line. When in doubt, refer to the examples in the corresponding lorebook entry.

#### What's New
 - Added new tools: Perspective Converter, Summarizer, and Difficulty Assessor.
 - Renamed and shortened/clarified some existing tools. New names are:
    Do > Action Enforcer
    Say > Dialoguer
    Story > Descriptive Narrator
 - Broke out Tone Shifter from previous Story tool into its own tool.
 - Replaced some of the commands with ones that v4 Sigurd seems more naturally inclined to use for the same purpose.
 - Tweaked all of the examples to be more consistent (and thus more powerful/effective).
 - Adjusted the phrase biasing in a lot of cases to function better with Sigurd v4.
