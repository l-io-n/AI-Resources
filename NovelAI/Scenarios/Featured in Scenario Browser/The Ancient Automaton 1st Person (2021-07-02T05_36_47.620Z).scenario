{"scenarioVersion":0,"title":"The Ancient Automaton","description":"Explore a wild and strangely beautiful far future dystopia overrun by androids and exotic beasts. Play as an adventurer on the run in this classic choose-your-own-adventure style tale set in all original world.","prompt":"Nierheim is a verdant world atop the mechanical corpse of an ancient colossal titan. Beneath the lush exterior lies an endless labyrinth of impossible machinery, and at its heart sleeps a terrible power. Despite centuries of cataclysms, a sparse few societies have survived. The inhabitants scour frozen obsidian steppes, salt marshes, and jungles of sentient plants in search of mysterious artifacts left behind by long-dead civilizations. In the darkness old gods stir, heeding the call of long-forgotten magic and the resolution of a millennia-long mystery.\n***\nThe sky was dark when we made our way down the mountain trail. It had been nearly two days since we'd fled the city. My body ached all over—especially my head—but determination kept my mind clear. We'd made good time on our journey through the mountains, but we still hadn't reached the border yet. As the cloud layer began to clear, we spotted a figure crouching in the rust ahead. The woman stood as we approached, her back turned to us. She had a simple brown tunic and long damp hair.\n\"You've got to be kidding me,\" I muttered noticing the glint of polished chrome peaking from beneath a tear in her hip flesh. \"It's a doppel.\" I froze, my mind racing. It wouldn't be long before our pursuers caught up to us and now we had an android to contend with. Damn it! We had come too far for our journey to end now!\nThe doppel woman turned and regarded us carefully. Those round mirror eyes pierced the darkness like Ygra's twin moons weighing down the thick pitch of night. It felt as if a wild animal was looking through me, watching for any sign of weakness. I stretched my fingertips and reached for the hilt of my obsidian dagger.\n\"Wait\" came her voice, though the doppel's mouth did not move. Though her voice was artificial, there was something beautiful about the way she spoke. A moment passed as she processed our reaction. Then she continued: \"You are headed to the border.\" It was a statement, though she posed it as a question.\n\"Y-Yes,\" I replied. Another pause that felt an eternity.\n\"You will take me with you.\" she stated, again as a question. Her tone sounded almost pleading.","tags":["Fantasy","Science Fiction","Post-Apocalypse","Adventure","Far Future","Philosophical","Choose Your Own Adventure","CYOA","First Person"],"context":[{"text":"My name is ${Name}.
