{"scenarioVersion":0,"title":"The Mourning Bus","description":"A bus and its passengers are caught in a supernatural loop. Get to know the passengers and help them accept their fate or fight against it.","prompt":"It was a cold morning when the bus arrived. It was the typical handful of oddities I've come to recognize. One by one they shuffled up the steps until it was my turn. The familiar musk of warmed faux-leather hit me as I fell into the same lumpy seat I've always used. I stared out the smudged window and wondered if it would rain again today. That's when I saw her: An old woman with a mess of damp salt-and-pepper cotton on her head. She was shouting something and blocking the remaining regulars from getting on the bus. Eventually she was up the steps but hesitated once more at the front. She looked directly at me. Something about the empty resignation in those sunken eyes tickled my memory, though I couldn't place where. Did I know her? I turned my attention back to the window but after a moment I noticed she had stopped at my seat. I felt those eyes burning into me.\n\"It's time,\" she said.\n\"Excuse me?\"\nShe shifted into place next to me in a manner that felt familiar, though I had never seen this woman before. \"I'm sorry, Akane.\"\nA sudden chill. \"How do you know my name?\"\n\"We all die sometime.\" The bus wrenched and turned and eventually started. Why did this senile woman have to sit next to me? I scooted closer to the window and hoped this ride would be over soon.\nThe sky darkened. My fingertips ached. Tears began streaking down the side of the bus. Shivering, I hugged my thin jacket close and stuffed my hands into the pockets. It would be two more hours until we reached Tokyo. Then another thirty cold minutes walking to school. I thumbed idly at my apartment keys wishing I had brought my walkman.\nA loud bang made me jolt upright. Pain. The woman next to me was still as a corpse staring straight ahead, seemingly undisturbed by the bus backfiring. I withdrew my hand from my pocket to find that I had clenched my keys too tight and cut my thumb. I opened my hand and smelled copper. A flash obscured my vision. Lightning. Suddenly I was looking at both hands now covered in blood. They looked withered, wrinkled. Ancient. I was no longer on the bus but instead standing over a body. My body. It was strewn over the now broken window. Sirens. Smoke. Copper.\nI blinked. When I came to, I was at the bus stop by the side of the road once again. The sky was clear and the usual crowd was gathering for the morning commute. A dream? But something was off. I looked again at my hands, now clean but still wrinkled. I touched my hair. It was stiff like cotton. Then it dawned on me. I was the old woman. No, now I remembered: I was a shinigami, a spirit of death. I watched Akane get onto the bus. \"Wait!\" I yelled, my voice hoarse. \"Don't get on the bus!\" It was no use. Everything was playing out exactly as it had before. There was no way to save them as they were already dead. This cycle was going to loop endlessly until each passenger learned to accept their fate. I entered the bus and began climbing the steps. It wouldn't be easy to help these souls pass on. I had better get to work.\nBack on the bus, I noticed a salaryman","tags":["horror","weird","first person","female POV","supernatural","slice of life"],"context":[{"text":"A bus and its passengers are caught in a supernatural loop.
