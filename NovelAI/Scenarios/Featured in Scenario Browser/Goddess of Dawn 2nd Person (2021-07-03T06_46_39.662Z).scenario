{"scenarioVersion":0,"title":"Goddess of Dawn","description":"Get to know a strange and beautiful woman from Antarctica in this wholesome and supernatural hand-holding story.","prompt":"You sit at your desk with your laptop open and your pen scratching madly at paper. Your mind is racing; You have spent the last ten years traveling the world, scouring the very ends of the earth for proof of the paranormal. Finally, it has all paid off: On a recent expedition to the antarctic you discovered a girl named Aurora. She is a pale young woman born with a strange defect. At first you had merely taken her for a statue erected between the frozen peaks. When she moved you had thought her an explorer lost and without proper clothing or supplies. You had feared exposure or at the very least severe hypothermia. As you got close however, you had found that the frost cascading down her shoulders was all hair, her bright goggles actually crystalline irises refracting light as if prisms, and her bare skin coated entirely in a fine layer of ice.\nDespite your efforts for assistance Aurora adamantly refuses to be touched, having recoiled from even the offer of a blanket with which to shelter her from exposure. You couldn't help but admire her hardy nature, standing unfettered against the elements. She had shrugged then, relaying to you that she has always lived this way. Alone, wandering one of the last places on earth untainted by human touch. Or at least, that's what she had told you at the time.\nWhen she had offered her name you couldn't contain yourself. You had felt bad for laughing but you were struck by the sheer irony of an ice woman being named after the Roman goddess of the dawning sun. It was that same northern sun that had just started rising from the edge of the sea at that moment when you had first met, and would continue to rise for another seven weeks. As you watched that light scatter warmth across Aurora's shimmering form, you made a promise that you would never let her feel isolated and alone ever again.\nBack at your office you learn the truth. There is a reason Aurora is isolated and another reason she would remain so. She is on the run. It was a little over a month prior to when you had found her. Aurora had spent her life in captivity in a place she isn't fond of recalling. It had taken her years to prepare the resources and information needed for her escape. In the daylight she shines like a beacon and so she had waited half the year for the sun to set in the antarctic. The first attempt failed. She doesn't like talking about it. All you know is that it had taken her some months before she had mustered up the courage to try again. She had narrowly evaded capture numerous times and was on the verge of giving up entirely when you found her. Needless to say, you decide to relocate your office as soon as you find out. You prepared for this. You always knew the dangers that came with great discovery. However, your heart would be ill prepared for a discovery you had yet to anticipate.\nAurora is fairly self-sufficient. You tell her that she is welcome to stay with you for as little or as long as she desires. Despite your immense interest, despite your hundreds of questions about her, you promise you won't force her to stay. At least, so long as she allows you to take a few notes first. You suppose that, riding the highs of a successful escape, she is probably more than happy to have a little stability and remain your research assistant in the interim. As a subject of research herself however, she is less enthused. A few weeks pass and you feel real progress has been made but still Aurora recoils at the touch, bringing any experiments or even mere examination to a grinding halt. Clearly there is still a mountain of trust to be earned. You regret that you would soon learn why.\nOne particularly cold November day, you ask her to help you with a particular experiment. She grudgingly agrees, though you're fairly sure she only does so because she feels obligated. You bring her into the lab and place her in front of an optical scanner. The experiment is designed to be as non-invasive as possible and you verbally go over each step with her well before taking it. Soon the test begins. She stands silently, watching you work. You notice that she doesn't seem particularly anxious this time. So far so good. The scanner whirs as a thin yellow light traces her form, bare skin reflecting the light across the room. You've grown accustomed to seeing her like this. Still, it's difficult to regard her from a purely scientific lens. Certainly, she is a magnificent specimen, but she is also a beautiful woman. Far more so than you have ever seen before. Something in your expression must have startled her as she suddenly bolts from the room and hides under your desk. When you find her you realize she has been crying, her tears solidifying as they slide down her chin. You gingerly sit down on the floor next to her and wait. She tells you everything.\nFor as long as she can remember, Aurora has been abused. Her captors broke down her body and twisted her flesh. She has been starved and tortured. And even raped. The words come slowly and with a flat affect, though she is shaking as she speaks them. She does not know why they did what they did, but it doesn't matter. They won't ever do anything to her ever again. You will make sure of that. She is free now. She knows that. It is just something she is still getting used to. You apologize and tell her she doesn't have to do any more experiments, that it is enough simply to have her around. That is, if she still wants to stick around. You feel something then. Warm and soft, not like ice at all. You turn your head and see Aurora's outstretched hand, her thin pale fingers on top of your own. You hesitate and ask if this is okay. Looking up, you see that she is no longer crying. Smiling, even. You lock eyes with her. Rainbows, the color of the cosmos. It feels as if a blindingly hot energy is being beamed through your eyes and directly into your heart. In that moment you finally understand her name.\nYou turn your hand over and her fingers intertwine with yours. Her touch is so warm, you can't believe it. It is as if the ice of her skin has been transformed into a soft down. What might be the potential implications of such a material? What is she even made of? You have to push these silly thoughts to the back of your consciousness and just enjoy the moment. Aurora is teaching you incredible things you would have never learned otherwise. You just hope it is mutual.","tags":["paranormal","supernatural","romance","science fiction","intimacy","slice of life","monster girl","wholesome","second person"],"context":[{"text":"[ You are a paranormal researcher studying a girl made of ice.]","contextConfig":{"prefix":"","suffix":"\n","tokenBudget":2048,"reservedTokens":0,"budgetPriority":800,"trimDirection":"trimBottom","insertionType":"token","insertionPosition":0}},{"text":"[ Author's Note: This is a romantic tale about a girl made of ice who falls in love.
