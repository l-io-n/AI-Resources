{"scenarioVersion":0,"title":"God of Sun","description":"Get to know a strange and beautiful man from Antarctica in this wholesome and supernatural hand-holding story.","prompt":"I sat at my desk with my laptop open and my pen scratching madly at paper. My mind was racing; I had spent the last ten years traveling the world, scouring the very ends of the earth for proof of the paranormal. Finally, it had all paid off: On a recent expedition to the antarctic I had discovered a boy named Helios. He was a pale young man born with a strange defect. At first I had merely taken him for a statue erected between the frozen peaks. When he moved I had thought him an explorer lost and without proper clothing or supplies. I had feared exposure or at the very least severe hypothermia. As I got close however, I found that the frost cascading down his shoulders was all hair, his bright goggles actually crystalline irises refracting light as if prisms, and his bare skin coated entirely in a fine layer of ice.\nDespite my efforts for assistance Helios adamantly refused to be touched, recoiling from even the offer of a blanket with which to shelter him from exposure. I couldn't help but admire his hardy nature, standing unfettered against the elements. He had shrugged then, relaying to me that he had always lived this way. Alone, wandering one of the last places on earth untainted by human touch. Or at least, that's what he had told me at the time.\nWhen he offered his name I couldn't contain myself. I felt bad for laughing but I was struck by the sheer irony of an ice man named after the Greek god of the sun. It was that same northern sun that had just started rising from the edge of the sea at that moment when we had first met, and would continue to rise for another seven weeks. As I watched that light scatter warmth across Helios's shimmering form, I made a promise that I would never let him feel isolated and alone ever again.\nBack at my office I had learned the truth. There was a reason Helios was isolated and another reason he would remain so. He was on the run. It was a little over a month prior to when I had found him. Helios had spent his life in captivity in a place he isn't fond of recalling. It had taken him years to prepare the resources and information needed for his escape. In the daylight he shines like a beacon and so he had waited half the year for the sun to set in the antarctic. The first attempt failed. He doesn't like talking about it. All I know is that it had taken him some months before he had mustered up the courage to try again. He had narrowly evaded capture numerous times and was on the verge of giving up entirely when I had found him. Needless to say, we relocated my office as soon as I had found out. I was prepared. I always knew the dangers that came with great discovery. However, my heart was ill prepared for a discovery I had yet to anticipate.\nHelios was fairly self-sufficient. I had told him that he was welcome to stay with me for as little or as long as he desired. Despite my immense interest, despite my hundreds of questions about him, I promised I wouldn't force him to stay. At least, so long as he allowed me to take a few notes first. I suppose riding the highs of a successful escape, he was more than happy to have a little stability and remain my research assistant in the interim. As a subject of research himself however, he was less enthused. A few weeks had passed and I had thought real progress had been made but still Helios recoiled at the touch, bringing any experiments or even mere examination to a grinding halt. Clearly there was still a mountain of trust to be earned. I regret that I would soon learn why.\nOne particularly cold November day, I had asked him to help me with a particular experiment. He had grudgingly agreed, though I was sure he had only done so because he had felt obligated. I had brought him into the lab and placed him in front of an optical scanner. The experiment was designed to be as non-invasive as possible and I would verbally go over each step with him well before taking it. Soon the test had begun. He stood silently, watching me work. I had noticed that he didn't seem particularly anxious this time. So far so good. The scanner whirred as a thin yellow light traced his form, bare skin reflecting the light across the room. I had grown accustomed to seeing him like this. Still, it was difficult to regard him from a purely scientific lens. Certainly, he was a magnificent specimen, but he was also a beautiful man. Far more so than I had ever seen before. Something in my expression must have startled him as it was at that point that he suddenly bolted from the room and hid under my desk. When I found him I realized he had been crying, his tears solidifying as they slid down his chin. I gingerly sat down on the floor next to him and waited. He told me everything. \nFor as long as he could remember, Helios had been abused. His captors had broken down his body and twisted his flesh. He had been starved and tortured. And even raped. The words came slowly and with a flat affect, though he was shaking as he spoke them. He did not know why they did what they did, but it didn't matter. They wouldn't ever do anything to him ever again. I would make sure of that. He was free now. It was just something he was still getting used to. I apologized and told him we didn't have to do any more experiments, that it would be enough simply to have him around. That is, if he still wanted to stick around. I felt something then. Warm and soft, not like ice at all. I turned my head to see Helios's outstretched hand, his long pale fingers on top of mine. I hesitated and asked if this was okay. Looking up, I saw that he was no longer crying. Smiling, even. I locked eyes with him. Rainbows, the color of the cosmos. It felt as if a blindingly hot energy was being beamed through my eyes and directly into my heart. In that moment I finally understood his name.\nI turned my hand over and his fingers intertwined mine. His touch was so warm, I couldn't believe it. It was as if the ice of his skin had been transformed into a soft down. What would be the potential implications of such a material? What is he even made of? I had to push these silly thoughts to the back of my consciousness and just enjoy the moment. Helios was teaching me incredible things I would have never learned otherwise. I just hoped it was mutual.","tags":["paranormal","supernatural","romance","science fiction","intimacy","slice of life","monster boy","wholesome","first person"],"context":[{"text":"[ I am a paranormal researcher studying a man made of ice.]","contextConfig":{"prefix":"","suffix":"\n","tokenBudget":2048,"reservedTokens":0,"budgetPriority":800,"trimDirection":"trimBottom","insertionType":"token","insertionPosition":0}},{"text":"[ Author's Note: This is a romantic tale about a boy made of ice who falls in love.
