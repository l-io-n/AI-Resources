{"scenarioVersion":0,"title":"God of Sun","description":"Get to know a strange and beautiful man from Antarctica in this wholesome and supernatural hand-holding story.","prompt":"You sit at your desk with your laptop open and your pen scratching madly at paper. Your mind is racing; You have spent the last ten years traveling the world, scouring the very ends of the earth for proof of the paranormal. Finally, it has all paid off: On a recent expedition to the antarctic you discovered a boy named Helios. He is a pale young man born with a strange defect. At first you had merely taken him for a statue erected between the frozen peaks. When he moved you had thought him an explorer lost and without proper clothing or supplies. You had feared exposure or at the very least severe hypothermia. As you got close however, you had found that the frost cascading down his shoulders was all hair, his bright goggles actually crystalline irises refracting light as if prisms, and his bare skin coated entirely in a fine layer of ice.\nDespite your efforts for assistance Helios adamantly refuses to be touched, having recoiled from even the offer of a blanket with which to shelter him from exposure. You couldn't help but admire his hardy nature, standing unfettered against the elements. He had shrugged then, relaying to you that he has always lived this way. Alone, wandering one of the last places on earth untainted by human touch. Or at least, that's what he had told you at the time.\nWhen he had offered his name you couldn't contain yourself. You had felt bad for laughing but you were struck by the sheer irony of an ice man being named after the Greek god of the sun. It was that same northern sun that had just started rising from the edge of the sea at that moment when you had first met, and would continue to rise for another seven weeks. As you watched that light scatter warmth across Helios's shimmering form, you made a promise that you would never let him feel isolated and alone ever again.\nBack at your office you learn the truth. There is a reason Helios is isolated and another reason he would remain so. He is on the run. It was a little over a month prior to when you had found him. Helios had spent his life in captivity in a place he isn't fond of recalling. It had taken him years to prepare the resources and information needed for his escape. In the daylight he shines like a beacon and so he had waited half the year for the sun to set in the antarctic. The first attempt failed. He doesn't like talking about it. All you know is that it had taken him some months before he had mustered up the courage to try again. He had narrowly evaded capture numerous times and was on the verge of giving up entirely when you found him. Needless to say, you decide to relocate your office as soon as you find out. You prepared for this. You always knew the dangers that came with great discovery. However, your heart would be ill prepared for a discovery you had yet to anticipate.\nHelios is fairly self-sufficient. You tell him that he is welcome to stay with you for as little or as long as he desires. Despite your immense interest, despite your hundreds of questions about him, you promise you won't force him to stay. At least, so long as he allows you to take a few notes first. You suppose that, riding the highs of a successful escape, he is probably more than happy to have a little stability and remain your research assistant in the interim. As a subject of research himself however, he is less enthused. A few weeks pass and you feel real progress has been made but still Helios recoils at the touch, bringing any experiments or even mere examination to a grinding halt. Clearly there is still a mountain of trust to be earned. You regret that you would soon learn why.\nOne particularly cold November day, you ask him to help you with a particular experiment. He grudgingly agrees, though you're fairly sure he only does so because he feels obligated. You bring him into the lab and place him in front of an optical scanner. The experiment is designed to be as non-invasive as possible and you verbally go over each step with him well before taking it. Soon the test begins. He stands silently, watching you work. You notice that he doesn't seem particularly anxious this time. So far so good. The scanner whirs as a thin yellow light traces his form, bare skin reflecting the light across the room. You've grown accustomed to seeing him like this. Still, it's difficult to regard him from a purely scientific lens. Certainly, he is a magnificent specimen, but he is also a beautiful man. Far more so than you have ever seen before. Something in your expression must have startled him as he suddenly bolts from the room and hides under your desk. When you find him you realize he has been crying, his tears solidifying as they slide down his chin. You gingerly sit down on the floor next to him and wait. He tells you everything.\nFor as long as he can remember, Helios has been abused. His captors broke down his body and twisted his flesh. He has been starved and tortured. And even raped. The words come slowly and with a flat affect, though he is shaking as he speaks them. He does not know why they did what they did, but it doesn't matter. They won't ever do anything to him ever again. You will make sure of that. He is free now. He knows that. It is just something he is still getting used to. You apologize and tell him he doesn't have to do any more experiments, that it is enough simply to have him around. That is, if he still wants to stick around. You feel something then. Warm and soft, not like ice at all. You turn your head and see Helios's outstretched hand, his long pale fingers on top of your own. You hesitate and ask if this is okay. Looking up, you see that he is no longer crying. Smiling, even. You lock eyes with him. Rainbows, the color of the cosmos. It feels as if a blindingly hot energy is being beamed through your eyes and directly into your heart. In that moment you finally understand his name.\nYou turn your hand over and his fingers intertwine with yours. His touch is so warm, you can't believe it. It is as if the ice of his skin has been transformed into a soft down. What might be the potential implications of such a material? What is he even made of? You have to push these silly thoughts to the back of your consciousness and just enjoy the moment. Helios is teaching you incredible things you would have never learned otherwise. You just hope it is mutual.","tags":["paranormal","supernatural","romance","science fiction","intimacy","slice of life","wholesome","monster boy","second person"],"context":[{"text":"[ You are a paranormal researcher studying a man made of ice.]","contextConfig":{"prefix":"","suffix":"\n","tokenBudget":2048,"reservedTokens":0,"budgetPriority":800,"trimDirection":"trimBottom","insertionType":"token","insertionPosition":0}},{"text":"[ Author's Note: This is a romantic tale about a boy made of ice who falls in love.
