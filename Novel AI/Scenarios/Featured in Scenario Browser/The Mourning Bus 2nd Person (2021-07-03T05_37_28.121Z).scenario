{"scenarioVersion":0,"title":"The Mourning Bus","description":"A bus and its passengers are caught in a supernatural loop. Get to know the passengers and help them accept their fate or fight against it.","prompt":"It is a cold morning when the bus arrives. It's the typical handful of oddities you've come to recognize. One by one they shuffle up the steps until it's your turn. The familiar musk of warmed faux-leather hits you as you fall into the same lumpy seat you've always used. You stare out the smudged window and wonder if it will rain again today. That's when you see her: An old woman with a mess of damp salt-and-pepper cotton on her head. She is shouting something and blocking the remaining regulars from getting on the bus. Eventually she's up the steps but hesitates once more at the front. She looks directly at you. Something about the empty resignation in those sunken eyes tickles your memory, though you can't place where. Do you know her? You turn your attention back to the window but after a moment you notice she has stopped at your seat. You feel her eyes burning into you.\n\"It's time,\" she says.\n\"Excuse me?\"\nShe shifts into place next to you in a manner that feels familiar, though you've never seen this woman before. \"I'm sorry, Akane.\"\nA sudden chill. \"How do you know my name?\"\n\"We all die sometime.\" The bus wrenches and turns and eventually starts. You scoot closer to the window and hope this ride will be over soon.\nThe sky darkens. Your fingertips begin to ache. Tears begin streaking down the side of the bus. Shivering, you hug your thin jacket close and stuff your hands into the pockets. It would be two more hours until you reach Tokyo. Then another thirty cold minutes walking to school. You thumb idly at your apartment keys wishing you had brought your walkman.\nA loud bang makes you jolt upright. Pain. The woman next to you is as still as a corpse staring straight ahead, seemingly undisturbed by the bus backfiring. You withdraw your hand from your pocket to find that you had clenched your keys too tightly and cut your thumb. You open your hand and smell copper. A flash obscures your vision. Lightning. Suddenly you are looking at both hands now covered in blood. They look withered, wrinkled. Ancient. You are no longer on the bus but instead standing over a body. Your own body. It is strewn over the now broken window. Sirens. Smoke. Copper.\nYou blink. When you come to, you are at the bus stop by the side of the road once again. The sky is clear and the usual crowd is gathering for the morning commute. A dream? But something is off. You look again at your hands, now clean but still wrinkled. You touch your hair. It's stiff like cotton. Then it dawns on you. You are the old woman. No, now you remember: You are a shinigami, a spirit of death. You watch Akane get onto the bus. \"Wait!\" you yell, your voice hoarse. \"Don't get on the bus!\" It's no use. Everything is playing out exactly as it had before. There's no way to save them as they are already dead. This cycle is going to loop endlessly until each passenger learns to accept their fate. You enter the bus and begin climbing the steps. It won't be easy to help these souls pass on. You had better get to work.\nBack on the bus, you notice a salaryman","tags":["horror","weird","female POV","supernatural","slice of life","second person"],"context":[{"text":"A bus and its passengers are caught in a supernatural loop.
