{"scenarioVersion":0,"title":"The Ancient Automaton","description":"Explore a wild and strangely beautiful far future dystopia overrun by androids and exotic beasts. Play as an adventurer on the run in this classic choose-your-own-adventure style tale set in all original world.","prompt":"Nierheim is a verdant world atop the mechanical corpse of an ancient colossal titan. Beneath the lush exterior lies an endless labyrinth of impossible machinery, and at its heart sleeps a terrible power. Despite centuries of cataclysms, a sparse few societies have survived. The inhabitants scour frozen obsidian steppes, salt marshes, and jungles of sentient plants in search of mysterious artifacts left behind by long-dead civilizations. In the darkness old gods stir, heeding the call of long-forgotten magic and the resolution of a millennia-long mystery.\n***\nThe empty night sky looms overheard as you make your way down the mountain trail. It has been nearly two days since you fled the city. Your body aches all over—especially your head—but determination keeps your mind clear. So far you have made good time on your journey through the mountains, but you still haven't reached the border yet. As the cloud layer begins to clear, you spot a figure crouching in the rust ahead. The woman stands as you approach, her back turned to you. She has a simple brown tunic and long damp hair.\n\"You've got to be kidding me,\" you mutter noticing the glint of polished chrome peaking from beneath a tear in her hip flesh. \"It's a doppel.\" You freeze, your mind racing. It wouldn't be long before your pursuers catch up to you and now you have an android to contend with. Damn it! You have come too far for your journey to end now!\nThe doppel woman turns and regards you carefully. Those round mirror eyes pierce the darkness like Ygra's twin moons weighing down the thick pitch of night. It feels as if a wild animal is looking through you, watching for any sign of weakness. You stretch your fingertips and reach for the hilt of your obsidian dagger.\n\"Wait\" comes her voice, though the doppel's mouth does not move. Her voice is artificial, but there is something beautiful about the way it sounds. A moment passes as she processes your reaction. Then she continues: \"You are headed to the border.\" It is a statement, though she poses it as a question.\n\"Y-Yes,\" you reply. Another pause that feels like an eternity.\n\"You will take me with you.\" she states, again as a question. Her tone sounds almost pleading.","tags":["Fantasy","Science Fiction","Post-Apocalypse","Adventure","Far Future","Philosophical","Choose Your Own Adventure","CYOA","Second Person"],"context":[{"text":"Your name is ${Name}.
