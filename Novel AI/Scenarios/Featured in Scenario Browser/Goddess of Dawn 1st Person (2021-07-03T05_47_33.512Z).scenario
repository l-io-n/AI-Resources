{"scenarioVersion":0,"title":"Goddess of Dawn","description":"Get to know a strange and beautiful woman from Antarctica in this wholesome and supernatural hand-holding story.","prompt":"I sat at my desk with my laptop open and my pen scratching madly at paper. My mind was racing; I had spent the last ten years traveling the world, scouring the very ends of the earth for proof of the paranormal. Finally, it had all paid off: On a recent expedition to the antarctic I had discovered a girl named Aurora. She was a pale young woman born with a strange defect. At first I had merely taken her for a statue erected between the frozen peaks. When she moved I had thought her an explorer lost and without proper clothing or supplies. I had feared exposure or at the very least severe hypothermia. As I got close however, I found that the frost cascading down her shoulders was all hair, her bright goggles actually crystalline irises refracting light as if prisms, and her bare skin coated entirely in a fine layer of ice.\nDespite my efforts for assistance Aurora adamantly refused to be touched, recoiling from even the offer of a blanket with which to shelter her from exposure. I couldn't help but admire her hardy nature, standing unfettered against the elements. She had shrugged then, relaying to me that she had always lived this way. Alone, wandering one of the last places on earth untainted by human touch. Or at least, that's what she had told me at the time.\nWhen she offered her name I couldn't contain myself. I felt bad for laughing but I was struck by the sheer irony of an ice woman named after the Roman goddess of the dawning sun. It was that same northern sun that had just started rising from the edge of the sea at that moment when we had first met, and would continue to rise for another seven weeks. As I watched that light scatter warmth across Aurora's shimmering form, I made a promise that I would never let her feel isolated and alone ever again.\nBack at my office I had learned the truth. There was a reason Aurora was isolated and another reason she would remain so. She was on the run. It was a little over a month prior to when I had found her. Aurora had spent her life in captivity in a place she isn't fond of recalling. It had taken her years to prepare the resources and information needed for her escape. In the daylight she shines like a beacon and so she had waited half the year for the sun to set in the antarctic. The first attempt failed. She doesn't like talking about it. All I know is that it had taken her some months before she had mustered up the courage to try again. She had narrowly evaded capture numerous times and was on the verge of giving up entirely when I had found her. Needless to say, we relocated my office as soon as I had found out. I was prepared. I always knew the dangers that came with great discovery. However, my heart was ill prepared for a discovery I had yet to anticipate.\nAurora was fairly self-sufficient. I had told her that she was welcome to stay with me for as little or as long as she desired. Despite my immense interest, despite my hundreds of questions about her, I promised I wouldn't force her to stay. At least, so long as she allowed me to take a few notes first. I suppose riding the highs of a successful escape, she was more than happy to have a little stability and remain my research assistant in the interim. As a subject of research herself however, she was less enthused. A few weeks had passed and I had thought real progress had been made but still Aurora recoiled at the touch, bringing any experiments or even mere examination to a grinding halt. Clearly there was still a mountain of trust to be earned. I regret that I would soon learn why.\nOne particularly cold November day, I had asked her to help me with a particular experiment. She had grudgingly agreed, though I was sure she had only done so because she had felt obligated. I had brought her into the lab and placed her in front of an optical scanner. The experiment was designed to be as non-invasive as possible and I would verbally go over each step with her well before taking it. Soon the test had begun. She stood silently, watching me work. I had noticed that she didn't seem particularly anxious this time. So far so good. The scanner whirred as a thin yellow light traced her form, bare skin reflecting the light across the room. I had grown accustomed to seeing her like this. Still, it was difficult to regard her from a purely scientific lens. Certainly, she was a magnificent specimen, but she was also a beautiful woman. Far more so than I had ever seen before. Something in my expression must have startled her as it was at that point that she suddenly bolted from the room and hid under my desk. When I found her I realized she had been crying, her tears solidifying as they slid down her chin. I gingerly sat down on the floor next to her and waited. She told me everything. \nFor as long as she could remember, Aurora had been abused. Her captors had broken down her body and twisted her flesh. She had been starved and tortured. And even raped. The words came slowly and with a flat affect, though she was shaking as she spoke them. She did not know why they did what they did, but it didn't matter. They wouldn't ever do anything to her ever again. I would make sure of that. She was free now. It was just something she was still getting used to. I apologized and told her we didn't have to do any more experiments, that it would be enough simply to have her around. That is, if she still wanted to stick around. I felt something then. Warm and soft, not like ice at all. I turned my head to see Aurora's outstretched hand, her thin pale fingers on top of mine. I hesitated and asked if this was okay. Looking up, I saw that she was no longer crying. Smiling, even. I locked eyes with her. Rainbows, the color of the cosmos. It felt as if a blindingly hot energy was being beamed through my eyes and directly into my heart. In that moment I finally understood her name.\nI turned my hand over and her fingers intertwined mine. Her touch was so warm, I couldn't believe it. It was as if the ice of her skin had been transformed into a soft down. What would be the potential implications of such a material? What is she even made of? I had to push these silly thoughts to the back of my consciousness and just enjoy the moment. Aurora was teaching me incredible things I would have never learned otherwise. I just hoped it was mutual.","tags":["paranormal","supernatural","romance","science fiction","intimacy","slice of life","monster girl","wholesome","first person"],"context":[{"text":"[ I am a paranormal researcher studying a girl made of ice.]","contextConfig":{"prefix":"","suffix":"\n","tokenBudget":2048,"reservedTokens":0,"budgetPriority":800,"trimDirection":"trimBottom","insertionType":"token","insertionPosition":0}},{"text":"[ Author's Note: This is a romantic tale about a girl made of ice who falls in love.
